# It is difficult to assess from the plot above whether model assumptions are violated, since it is a
# combined histogram from a mix of different poission models (different expectation and variance).
# However, we still notice that there is unusually many observations with y_i = 0. Especially since the
# smallest t-value in the dataset is 5, indicating an expectation of at least 5.833 for each of the
# assumed poisson-distributed y_i. Considering this, it is highly unlikely to observe as many zeros as we
# in our data set. We therefore believe that the assumption of each y_i being poisson-distributed is violated.
# However, excluding the y_i = 0 observations, the rest appear to be approximately poisson-distributed.
